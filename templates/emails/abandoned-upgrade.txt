Hi there,

Looks like you were trying to upgrade Calenduck but didn't complete the process...
You can still receive notifications by typing "/duck update" from your workspace!

Still not convinced? Just reply to this email if you feel like a feature is missing or if you'd like a custom plan :)

All the best,
Andy
